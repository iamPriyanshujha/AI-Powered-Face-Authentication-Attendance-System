# AI-Powered-Face-Authentication-Attendance-System
An AI-driven zero-shot biometric system built with TypeScript, React, and Node.js. It features 1:N face verification, liveness detection (blink/smile checks), and anti-spoofing logic via vision-based analysis. Optimized for rapid prototyping, it uses structured prompt engineering rather than traditional manual model training.
