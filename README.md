AI-Powered Face Authentication & Attendance System
An intelligent, zero-shot biometric solution for real-time identity verification and attendance tracking. This system leverages vision-based analytical logic and challenge-response mechanisms to ensure secure user authentication without traditional model training.
🚀 Overview
Unlike traditional systems relying on fixed embeddings, this project uses a vision-based analytical approach. It processes live facial data holistically, comparing landmark positioning (eyes, nose, jawline) against registered user data to determine identity with high confidence.
✨ Key Features
1:N Face Verification: Matches live captures against a database of registered users.

Liveness Detection: Implements a challenge-response system (e.g., blinking, smiling) to thwart static image attacks.

Spoof Prevention: Detects visual anomalies like screen glare, flat textures, and unnatural lighting typical of mobile replays or printed photos.

Zero-Shot Logic: Driven by structured prompt engineering and JSON-based validation rather than manual dataset fine-tuning.
